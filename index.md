## Core Skills

Python, C#, API development

## Interests

Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering

## Work Experience

`Jul 2022 - Oct 2022`
__Co-Founder at SteadyBreeze__, Helsinki, Finland

Tested two promising ideas around renewable energy demand and generation matching. During the problem validation phase, we understood that a scalable product could not be built around the problem given the market dynamics. We did AB testing, interviewed industry experts, built technical MVPs of the products and analyzed the data gathered from test users.

`Jun 2019 - Sep 2022`
__Software Designer at Atostek Oy__, Espoo, Finland

Built software solutions to industry & healthcare problems. Key technologies I worked with: Python, C#, .NET, C++.

My main contributions: 
* My master's thesis that I got to do as a part of an industrial chatbot project. In my thesis, I explored the possibilities of injecting chatbots with contextual information using ontologies (graph presentations of languages or domains), thus improving their understanding of the surrounding world. The thesis included a Python implementation.
* Building a centralized server for storing medical images (DICOM) and patient data for a customer that manufactures medical devices. The main technologies used were ASP.NET Core, fo-dicom and postgres. I built an API for manipulating the data on the server, backend logic for DICOM operations, and a frontend management console using ASP.NET Core MVC model along with MaterializeCSS.
* Other projects I worked on included a computer vision application using a Tensorflow-trained model, building the user interface for an industrial-scale oil refinery simulator using .NET, and multiple different healthcare-related projects.

`May 2018 - Aug 2018`
__Summer Trainee at Nixu Corporation__, Espoo, Finland

Spent the summer of 2018 developing a data management system in the Managed Security Services business unit of Nixu. This system aggregated and provided a meaningful way to tap into the Threat Intelligence data it received for the analysts who used it daily. The core system was built with Python using Flask and contained microservices with varying technologies.

`May 2017 - Sep 2017`
__Junior Software Developer at Fenix Solutions__, Espoo, Finland

During my summer with Fenix Solutions I had the chance to get familiar with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. My main tasks were building plugin programs for integrating the CRM to other systems using C# as well as technical consultation of customers. I learned a whole bunch about .NET environment and working in a technical consulting business.

`Jun 2016 - Aug 2016`
__Trainee at Lappeenranta University of Technology__, Lappeenranta, Finland

I was a summer trainee in the laboratory of electricity markets where I worked with MS Excel and Matlab, translated course materials and created Moodle courses. I also got to plan and act in a series of educational clips about sustainable consumer choices and environmental awareness along with other summer trainees. Working here boosted my skills in Matlab and made me realize that being a researcher is not for me.

My personal favourite was Junction 2017, Europe's largest hackathon, which we participated in with a team of three coders and two designers. We created a VR game, without mentionable experience about the domain beforehand, which won the game jam track and got us into the finals (top 6 projects). A great experience overall and learned a bunch about Unity, developing for HTC Vive and pitching without having slept properly for a few days.
