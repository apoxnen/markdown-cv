## Work Experience

`Jan 2023 - Now`
**Data Engineer at Smartbi**, Helsinki, Finland

Working on building AI/ML solutions for industrial businesses. Key technologies I worked with: Python, Azure, Kubernetes, SQL and no-SQL databases, AWS, TypeScript, Node.js, Docker

Main contributions include:

- Designing and implementing a modular Python-based data processing engine that is a core component of a family of client products. The engine reads, processes and analyzes the input data and produces results such as recommendations for the end users, commands for automatic controlling of hardware devices, signal validation and statistical information. Each installation uses a site-spesific configuration file, which are constantly modified by the client. The engine is a highly flexible and configurable solution easily introduced to new operational contexts, while maintaining high performance and reliability across all deployments.
- Integrating the data processing engine into various client products, working closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, engineers, and stakeholders, to ensure smooth integration and alignment with client needs. This process involves handling databases, transforming data into engine-supported formats, and implementing as well as consuming various APIs. Key challenges addressed include ensuring seamless integration across diverse systems, optimizing performance in real-time data processing, and maintaining compatibility with evolving client requirements. Main technologies I worked with include Microsoft Azure, Python, SQL, TypeScript, FastAPI, and Express.
- Modernizing another client's AWS cloud infrastructure: together with the team we automatized and improved the efficiency of data pipelines and monitoring. We achieved significant cost cuts while simultaneously simplifiying the architecture.

`Jul 2022 - Oct 2022`
**Co-Founder at SteadyBreeze**, Helsinki, Finland

Tested two promising ideas around renewable energy demand and generation matching. During the problem validation phase, we understood that a scalable product could not be built around the problem given the market dynamics. We did AB testing, interviewed industry experts, built technical MVPs of the products and analyzed the data gathered from test users.

`Jun 2019 - Sep 2022`
**Software Designer at Atostek Oy**, Espoo, Finland

Built software solutions to industry & healthcare problems. Key technologies: Python, C#, .NET, C++, Docker.

My main contributions:

- My master's thesis that I got to do as a part of an industrial chatbot project. In my thesis, I explored the possibilities of injecting chatbots with contextual information using ontologies (graph presentations of languages or domains), thus improving their understanding of the surrounding world. The thesis included a Python implementation.
- Building a centralized server for storing medical images (DICOM) and patient data for a customer that manufactures medical devices. The main technologies used were ASP.NET Core, fo-dicom and postgres. I built an API for manipulating the data on the server, backend logic for DICOM operations, and a frontend management console using ASP.NET Core MVC model along with MaterializeCSS.
- Other projects I worked on included a computer vision application using a Tensorflow-trained model, building the user interface for an industrial-scale oil refinery simulator using .NET, and multiple different healthcare-related projects.

`May 2018 - Aug 2018`
**Summer Trainee at Nixu Corporation**, Espoo, Finland

Spent the summer of 2018 developing a data management system in the Managed Security Services business unit of Nixu. This system aggregated and provided a meaningful way to tap into the Threat Intelligence data it received for the analysts who used it daily. The core system was built with Python using Flask and contained microservices with varying technologies.

`May 2017 - Sep 2017`
**Junior Software Developer at Fenix Solutions**, Espoo, Finland

During my summer with Fenix Solutions I had the chance to get familiar with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. My main tasks were building plugin programs for integrating the CRM to other systems using C# as well as technical consultation of customers. I learned a whole bunch about .NET environment and working in a technical consulting business.

`Jun 2016 - Aug 2016`
**Trainee at Lappeenranta University of Technology**, Lappeenranta, Finland

I was a summer trainee in the laboratory of electricity markets where I worked with MS Excel and Matlab, translated course materials and created Moodle courses. I also got to plan and act in a series of educational clips about sustainable consumer choices and environmental awareness along with other summer trainees. Working here boosted my skills in Matlab and made me realize that being a researcher is not for me.

## Education

Aaltoes stands for Aalto Entrepreneurship Society, the largest and most active student-run entrepreneurship community in Europe.

I was the main organizer of Kiuas Team Up held in October 2017, which is a weekend-long program that brought together about 100 individuals interested in getting into entrepreneurship and provided them with easy access to workshops and coaches of many different industries.

During my time with Aaltoes I have also worked with some other projects like Heltech aka HKI Tech Meetup, which is a monthly event targeting cutting-edge topics.

**Secretary**, Sätky Ry, _Lappeenranta, Finland_

I was the secretary of the student organization of electrical engineering students in Lappeenranta.

## Projects & Awards

**Hackathons**

I've attended multiple hackathons in the Helsinki region during my studies. These include the likes of Finnish Game Jam, Stupid Hackathon and Junction. My personal favourite was Junction 2017, Europe's largest hackathon, which we participated in with a team of three coders and two designers. We created a VR game which won the game jam track and got us into the finals (top 6 projects). A great experience overall and learned a bunch about Unity, developing for HTC Vive and pitching without having slept properly for a few days.
